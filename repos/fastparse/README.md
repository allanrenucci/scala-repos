FastParse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lihaoyi/fastparse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lihaoyi/fastparse) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/lihaoyi/Ammonite](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/lihaoyi/fastparse?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
=========

This is where the code for the FastParse parsing library lives! If you want
to use Fastparse, you probably will want to check out the documentation:

- [Documentation](https://lihaoyi.github.io/fastparse)

This readme contains some developer docs, if you intend on working on the fastparse repo, not just using it as a library.

Developer Docs
==============

The core of FastParse lives in the `fastparse/` folder. It is cross-built ScalaJVM/Scala.js codebase, with almost everything shared between the two platforms in the `fastparse/shared/` and minor differences in `fastparse/js/` and `fastparse/jvm/`.

The two subprojects `scalaparse/` and `pythonparse/` are FastParse parsers for those respective languages. These are both usable as standalone libraries, and also serve as extensive test-suites and use-cases for FastParse itself. Each of those projects clones & parses large quantities of code from Github as part of *their* own test suites.

`util/` contains some basic utilities that FastParse uses that aren't specific to parsers: bitsets, escaping, tries, etc.. `readme/` contains the documentation site, which contains several live demos of FastParse parsers compiled to Scala.js. These all live in `demo/`.

Common Commands
---------------

- `sbt ~fastparseJVM/test` runs the main testsuite. If you're hacking on FastParse, this is often where you want to go
- You can run the other suites for `fastparseJS`, `scalaparseJVM`, etc. if you wish, but I typically don't and leave that to CI unless I'm actively working on the sub-project
- You can use `+` to run it under different Scala versions, but again I usually don't bother
- `+modules/test` is the aggregate test-all command, and `+modules/publishSigned` is publish-all. Other things (`compile`, etc.) can also be run on `modules`
- `readme/run` builds the documentation site, which can then be found at `readme/target/scalatex/index.html`

Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

- **If you're not sure if something is a bug or not, ask on Gitter first =)**
- **All code PRs should come with**: a meaningful description, inline comments for important things, unit tests, and a green build
- **Non-trivial changes, including bug fixes, should appear in the changelog**. Feel free to add your name and link to your github profile!
- **New features should be added to the relevant parts of the documentation**
- **To a large extent, FastParse is designed so that you can extend it in your own code** without needing to modify the core. If you want to add features, be prepared to argue why it should be built-in and not just part of your own code.
- **It's entirely possible your changes won't be merged**, or will get ripped out later. This is also the case for my changes, as the Author!
- **Even a rejected/reverted PR is valuable**! It helps explore the solution space, and know what works and what doesn't. For every line in the repo, at least three lines were tried, committed, and reverted/refactored, and more than 10 were tried without committing.
- **Feel free to send Proof-Of-Concept PRs** that you don't intend to get merged.
- **No binary or source compatibility is guaranteed between any releases**. FastParse is still in the 0.x.y phase of development, which means it's still under rapid development and things do change. On the other hand, upgrading is usually trivial, and I don't expect existing functionality to go away
